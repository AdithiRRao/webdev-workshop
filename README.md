# Completed

> This branch contains the complete HTML, CSS and JS implementation of our workshop.
> 
> You can use it as a reference whenever you want to learn how something was finally implemented.
> 
> Once you switch to this branch, a good practice is to create a new working branch from it using your GitHub username. For example I would create a new branch **renzil/completed** from this branch before I begin.
