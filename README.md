# Renzil's Web Development Workshop

This repository contains source code for a web development workshop where we learn Git, HTML, CSS and Javascript while building a Hollywood-themed quiz game [like this](https://hollywood-quiz.renzil.com).

Before you begin, please fork this repository into your GitHub account by clicking the Fork button in GitHub (usually on the top right).

You must then choose an editor for coding. There are many choices that will work, but if you're new I highly recommend using the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io). It is basically a web version of the popular Visual Studio Code with a generous free tier.

Once you signup for Gitpod with your GitHub credentials, make sure you have checked the permissions "user:email" and "public_repo" in https://gitpod.io/integrations -> Git Providers -> GitHub -> Edit Permissions.
